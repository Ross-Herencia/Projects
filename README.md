# Projects
Here I have complied a selection of projects from my first year of studying physics.  
+ A2.7 was an assignment to write code which could accept simple instructions from a text document and create a drawing from them.  
+ A3 was a collaborative project between Peter Nguyen Minh and I to clean and plot global temperature data from the past 150 years. This was accompanied by a brief report summarising our results.  
+ exp5 is an example of how I utilised the skills I had learnt in my coding module to take an alternative approach to the analysis of my experimental results for the cooling of various liquids. My aim was to determine if the cooling followed Newton's or Lorentz's cooling laws by plotting data that should give a straight line if the law is obeyed. The final report is also included.
